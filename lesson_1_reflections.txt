How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

 It shows only difference/ If t one file is correct then one can see error in differencies.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

 I can compare different versions and work with more adoptable one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 I can save version which I like.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 Because google docs works with only one file then the git which works with different files that can be changed in compilating process.
 
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 In log I can see what I changed and in diff how.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 It's great.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 For init and push.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? 

 I will try to control my code.
